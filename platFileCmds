Shows the IP Config of a remote controller
plat ipconfig
To select the correct controller add the -h:<ord> in this case an IP address so the ord is prefixed with ip:[ip address]
plat ipconfig -h:ip:192.168.1.140
By default it will look for the unsecure platform port on 3011 to change this add -p:<port>
plat ipconfig -h:ip:192.168.1.140 -p:5011
You will need the platform user and password and you will be prompted for them
